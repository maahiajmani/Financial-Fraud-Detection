 # Financial Fraud Detection System

A system to detect fraudulent transactions using Python, SQL, and Excel.

## Project Overview

The Financial Fraud Detection System aims to detect fraudulent transactions within financial datasets using machine learning-based anomaly detection techniques. The system utilizes models like Isolation Forest to identify outliers in transaction data, marking them as suspicious or fraudulent. By using anomaly detection, this system helps prevent financial fraud by flagging unusual transactions that deviate from normal patterns. 

This project is beneficial for fintech companies and financial institutions that need to monitor transactions in real-time and detect fraudulent behavior swiftly.

## Features
- Fraud Detection: Identifies suspicious or anomalous transactions in real-time.
- Machine Learning Models: Uses Isolation Forest for anomaly detection.
- Data Storage: SQL integration for storing transaction data and results.
- Visualization: Graphs and plots to visualize anomalies and trends in the data.
- Excel Integration: Export results to Excel for further analysis and reporting.
- Scalability: Can be adapted for use in large-scale financial operations.

## Technologies Used
This section lists the libraries, tools, and programming languages used to build the project.

- Python: The primary programming language for the project.
- SQL (SQLite): Used to store and query transaction data.
- Pandas: For data manipulation and preprocessing.
- NumPy : Used for handling arrays and numerical operations.
- Scikit-learn : Used for implementing machine learning algorithms such as Isolation Forest.
- Matplotlib & Seaborn: For visualizing data and results.
- Excel: Export results for further analysis.
- Jupyter Notebook: For initial data analysis and model exploration.

```

## How to Use

1. Prepare the Data:
   - The project uses two data files: `transactions.csv` and `fraud_data.xlsx`. You can modify these files to add your own data.
   
2. Run the Fraud Detection Script:
   - Open the Python script `fraud_detection.py` in a Python environment (like Jupyter Notebook or directly in an IDE).
   - Run the script to detect fraudulent transactions using the machine learning model.

3. View the Results:
   - After running the script, the results of detected fraud will be saved as an Excel file in the `reports/` folder. You can open this file to see which transactions were flagged as fraudulent.
